Overview

This project is a Python-based tool that uses the SymPy library to perform symbolic differentiation. It includes a function to compute the derivative of any given mathematical expression with respect to a specified variable.

Features
Calculate the derivative of any mathematical function.
Supports single-variable differentiation.

Prerequisites
SymPy: Install the SymPy library for symbolic mathematics.

How to Use
Import the SymPy library and the dy_dx function from the project.
Define a symbolic variable and a mathematical function.
Pass the function and the variable to the dy_dx function to compute its derivative.

Future Enhancements
Add support for higher-order derivatives.
Include integration features.
Add support for multi-variable calculus (partial derivatives).
